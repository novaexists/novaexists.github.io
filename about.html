        <h1>Photographer, Designer, Tech Enthusiast</h1>
        <p>My name is Nova.<br>
            Born and raised in Memphis, Tennessee I grew up in a home with little in the way of creativity.<br> 
            Art was not important in my childhood home, but I sought it out. I started by saving my lunch money <br>
            in middle school for those disposable cameras from Walgreens. Once social media took the world by storm, <br>
            my creativity took on a whole new outlet, as I discovered web design. On my 13th birthday I was gifted a camera<br>
            by my grandmother. From that point forward, I was either snapping photos or redesigning my Myspace page for the millionth time.<br><br>

            With photography, my passion is candid moments. <br>
            I love traveling to a new city, or a busy festival and blending into the background. <br>
            (As much as that is possible with a giant camera) I love capturing the moments that aren't often seen. <br>
            They seem the most authentic to me. In my time as a photographer I have captured weddings, graduations, festivals, <br>
            raves, flow arts such as fire spinning, and plenty of street photography. I have also had the opportunity to collaborate <br>
            with my friends and create amazing personal shoots for their creative pursuits. <br><br>

            With design, I strive to learn new things as often as possible. <br>
            I see a website as a puzzle that can fit together in innumerable ways, <br>
            and I want to find them all. I am currently brushing up on my Javascript, <br>
            so that I can continue to freelance in this amazing, creative industry.
